# ðŸŒ² BST: A Type of Binary Tree

- Great for **comparing** things
- Great for **search** stuff
- Stores **relationships between the stores datapoints**

The cool diagram:

ðŸ˜² **Observations:**

- The root node can have any value.
- The left child of a node will always have a **lower** value than the parent node.
- The right child of a node will always have a **higher** value than the parent node.
- The parent node will always have a value **greater than** any value in its left subtree and **less than** any value in its right subtree.

## ðŸ¤” Balanced vs Unbalanced tree

![unbalanced-tree](../../images/unbalanced-tree.png)

Wow, we have the **optimal performance of the binary search tree** of `O(log N)` and we're happy?

Nay, we when the tree becomes **unbalanced** - which means it looses the relation that it should supposed to hold, it **quickly becomes the linked list** and gives is the performance of `O(n)` instead of `O(log n)`.

So,

| Operation    | Balanced Tree | Unbalanced Tree |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Insertion    | O(log n)       | O(n)            |
| Deletion     | O(log n)       | O(n)            |
| Lookup       | O(log n)       | O(n)            |


You see where is it going!

> To solve this, we have methods **to balance the tress** like:
> - AVL Trees
> - Red Black tree

We will discuss them later, as these methods will **guerentee** that even after many insertions and deletions, we will have the `O(log N)` performance.

## BST Pros and Cons

### Binary Search Tree (BST) Cheat Sheet

#### Advantages and Disadvantages of Binary Search Tree (BST)

| **Advantage** | **Disadvantage** |
|---|---|
| **Efficient Search Operations**<br>Average Time Complexity: O(log n).<br>Due to the binary nature, each comparison skips about half of the remaining tree, making search operations significantly faster compared to linear structures. | **Unbalanced Trees**<br>Worst-case Time Complexity: O(n).<br>If the tree becomes unbalanced (e.g., resembling a linked list), the efficiency of search, insertion, and deletion operations degrades significantly. |
| **Efficient Insertion and Deletion**<br>Average Time Complexity: O(log n).<br>Insertion and deletion operations also benefit from the logarithmic time complexity in a balanced tree, allowing for efficient dynamic data management. | **Requires Balancing**<br>Maintaining Balance: Additional algorithms needed.<br>To keep the tree balanced and maintain O(log n) complexity, additional balancing algorithms (such as those used in AVL or Red-Black Trees) must be implemented, which adds complexity and computational overhead. |
| **Sorted Data**<br>In-Order Traversal: O(n).<br>In-order traversal of a BST produces elements in ascending order, which is useful for operations that require sorted data without additional sorting algorithms. | **Space Complexity**<br>Pointer Overhead: O(n).<br>Each node in the BST requires additional storage for pointers to its children, which can be significant, especially in memory-constrained environments. |
| **Dynamic Growth and Shrinkage**<br>Flexible Size: Grows and shrinks with operations.<br>A BST can dynamically grow and shrink with insertions and deletions, providing flexible data management without requiring a predefined size. | **Complexity of Algorithms**<br>Advanced Operations: Complex to implement.<br>Algorithms for balancing (like tree rotations in AVL or Red-Black Trees) can be complex to implement and understand, requiring a deeper understanding of tree dynamics. |
| **Simple Binary Structure**<br>Ease of Implementation: Simpler than advanced trees.<br>The basic binary structure of a BST is easier to understand and implement compared to more complex data structures like AVL or Red-Black Trees. | **Handling Duplicates**<br>Value Duplication: Complicates structure.<br>BSTs typically do not handle duplicate values well, and managing duplicates may require extra mechanisms, adding complexity to the structure. |
