# Why!?

- The stacks and queues are the **data structures** just like arrays and linked list - but they are build on top of them.
- These are **high level** data structures.
- These allow **limited set of operations** on the low level data structures like arrays or linked lists.
- These are used in certain situations.

## Stacks (LIFO)

- lookup - `O(n)`
- pop - `O(1)`
- push - `O(1)`
- peek - `O(1)`

> Good with Arrays 👍🏻👍🏻

## Queues (FIFO)

- lookup - `O(n)`
- enqueue (push) - `O(1)`
- dequeue (pop) - `O(1)`
- peek - `O(1)`
